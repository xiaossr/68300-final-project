    <h1>Quantifying Spatial Locality in Vision Transformers</h1>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>1. Introduction and Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized image recognition by replacing convolutional operations with global self-attention, achieving top-tier performance on benchmarks like ImageNet. Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which build in local receptive fields by design, ViTs operate over sequences of image patches with no explicit bias toward nearby pixels. Yet practitioners and theorists alike have noted that ViTs often display strong local behavior, especially in early layers, hinting at an emergent spatial inductive bias.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding how ViTs balance global context against local structure is critical for interpretability and for guiding architectural improvements. If local interactions dominate early layers, one might imagine hybrid models that explicitly combine convolutional kernels with self-attention. Conversely, if global heads already capture most of the information, simpler Transformer-only designs may suffice. Our project explores this tension by systematically perturbing token representations at various spatial distances and measuring the effect on downstream predictions. By ablating “local” versus “distant” tokens in a controlled manner, we aim to quantify the true importance of spatial locality in each attention head and layer.

      <h2>2. Background and Related Work</h2>
      <p>
        The original ViT formulation by Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) demonstrated that pure Transformer architectures - when trained on large-scale datasets - can match or surpass CNN performance on image classification tasks [1]. Subsequent variants, such as DeiT (Touvron et al., 2021), improved data efficiency through distillation techniques, but retained the global self-attention mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recent analyses have probed the inner workings of ViTs. Caron et al. (2023) studied patch-level attention patterns, finding that certain heads specialize in local edge detection while others capture long-range dependencies [2]. Kazemied et al. (2024) extended this by evaluating how token information is retained across layers, suggesting that intermediate layers preserve more spatial structure than very deep or very shallow ones [3]. However, both studies relied primarily on attention-weight visualizations or information-theoretic measures rather than direct perturbation experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
        In parallel, the LessWrong community's work on multimodal audio interpretability uncovered that - even without spatial architectures - attention mechanisms can develop localized grouping behaviors when tasked with spectrogram representations [4]. These findings inspired our hypothesis that ViTs may likewise reduce to local processing under certain conditions, despite their global connectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Literature Gap.</strong> While prior work has catalogued attention weight patterns [2], information retention [3], and analogies in audio models [4], there remains a lack of empirical studies that directly compare the impact of local versus distant token perturbations on final model outputs. In particular, no published work has systematically ablated tokens at varying spatial distances and quantified the resulting performance degradation across layers and heads. Our project fills this gap by designing a perturbation-based framework to measure spatial locality in ViTs at scale, providing both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.
